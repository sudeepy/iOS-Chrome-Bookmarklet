# Chrome Bookmarklet for iOS
I'm super excited about [Chrome for iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chrome/id535886823?mt=8). However, unlike Android, iOS does not allow you to register alternate default browsers. So when you open a link in your email/text message/etc, you're stuck with Safari. Until Apple changes this, here's the next best thing: a bookmarklet to help bridge the gap to Chrome. So now, any page you open in Safari, you can transfer straight to Chrome.

# Setup
Here's the bookmarklet: <pre><code>javascript:window.location=document.location.href.replace('http://','googlechrome://');</pre></code>

For setup instructions, you can follow [this tutorial](http://iosbookmarklets.com/tutorials/pinterest-bookmarklet-ipad/) with following modifications:
* Ignore steps 2 and 3.
* For step 4, copy the code above.
* For step 7, you'll want choose a name like "Open in Chrome."
* For step 8, paste the code above.

That's it! Enjoy [Chrome for iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chrome/id535886823?mt=8)!
